### Open the HTML file in your browser and open the dev tools 

## In the Elements panel:

* Inspect the structure of the boxes.
* Try changing the background color of a box directly in the Elements panel.
* Add a new class to one of the boxes (e.g., 'highlight') and give it a border in the Styles pane.


## In the Console panel:

* Use document.getElementsByClassName('box') to get all the boxes. How many are there?
* Create a new box using createBox() function and log it to the console.
* Use container.appendChild() to add the new box you created to the page.


## In the Sources panel:

* Set a breakpoint in the getRandomColor function.
* Refresh the page and use the step-through debugging to see how the random color is generated.


Use console.log() to print the color of each box after it's created.
